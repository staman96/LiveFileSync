# Live File Syncronization

   This exercise's purpose was to make multiple processes using syscalls(fork/exec), make them communicate through pipes and use low level I/O. Also, bash scripts were used. These tools were used to create a program that syncs files between different directories. Different processes are used for each file that needs to be copied.
